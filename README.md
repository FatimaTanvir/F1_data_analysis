 **🏎 Beyond the Finish Line: A Deep Dive into Formula 1**
 =======================================================================

🏁 ***Project Overview***
 =======================
 This R-powered project takes a thrilling journey through the history of Formula 1, analyzing a rich dataset spanning from the sport's inception in 1950 up to the 2024 season. By employing statistical scrutiny and dynamic visualizations, we dissect the performance evolution of current F1 teams. Our analysis spotlights trends in qualifying prowess, race victories, fastest lap speeds, and overall consistency, offering a data-driven perspective on the ever-evolving landscape of Formula 1 racing. We also put the iconic team, Ferrari, under the microscope for a more granular examination of their historical performance.
